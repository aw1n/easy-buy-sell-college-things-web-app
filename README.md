# easy-buy-sell-college-things-web-app
easy buy/sell college things web app is implemented as part as part of my sixth semester college project.We will be using django web application framework and postgresql as database.
The purpose of this project is to allow college students to get college needed things easily at lesser price.Students can search if product is available in products library and
if avialable they can check if it is available in their college.
If user is interested in buying things checkout will schedule meeting between seller and buyer.
Buyer can also contact seller through mobile, however it is upto seller to keep mobile number as private or not.
The web app will allow guest user to browse through products library.
For adding products user will have to register themselves.
Home page will feature top sellers and most bought products.
